Additions:
- speaking with wolves to command them to grovel
- telling [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] to drop prone to avoid [[Needle Blight]] attacks
- hiding [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]] next to the toppled cauldron to make it seem like he was attacked by zombies

Subtractions:
- Spending two turns of combat to crit fail a persuasion check against a swarm of rats that were already almost dead and were in no way a threat to us
- The [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]] point is removed due to Zach's pedantry on what constitutes a "tactic"
