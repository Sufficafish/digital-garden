![[Strahd.png]]
Dread Lord and Master of [[Barovia]], a vampyr, likely trapped there after [[Kolyan Indirovich]] called for [[Barovia]] to be sealed away following [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s attack on his adopted daughter [[Ireena Kolyana]]. At least one man believed him summonable through torture and murder, with enough power to grant imortality.
