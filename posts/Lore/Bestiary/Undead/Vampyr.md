Supposedly true per [[Ismark Kolyanavich|Ismark]]:
- they must sleep in their coffins during the day
- a vampyre cannot enter a residence uninvited
- vampyres possess a hypnotic gaze
- it takes three bites to turn someone, and they must come with some time apart
- running water burns them like acid
- sunlight causes them to burst into flame
- allergic to garlic

Per the [[Tome of Strahd]]:
- vulnerable only to the sun's light
- a stake through the heart will keep a [[Vampyr]] in place for a time but not kill them
- supposedly some "cursed sword" that [[Sergei]] once owned is also a significant threat
