- the wagon [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] came to [[Barovia]] in with [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] is outside of the tower.
- close to the tower everyone except [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] begins to sense a strange tingling
- The tower's front door has a word, "Khazan", and a series of symbols on it: ![[Tower Door.png]]
- [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] performs the indicated dance and the door unlocks, revealing a curtain. Through the curtain is a small room with four clay statues and a chain elevator. [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] steps onto the elevator platform and the statues begin pulling the chains, lowering a platform down. Meanwhile [[Mercurie Slypher|Mercurie]] climbs some rickety scaffolding outside.
- Everyone except [[Mercurie Slypher|Mercurie]] steps onto the elevator platform but nothing happens. [[Ellory Vellum|Ellory]] slaps one of the statues on the ass and it comes to life. [[Ellory Vellum|Ellory]] immediately retreats and apologizes, and the statue returns to its normal state. He then asks that the statues "please ascend the elevator" and they do so.
- the elevator ascends through two weather-destroyed floors before reaching the top, which is better maintained with several basic comforts. [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] is inside, and as the elevator rises [[Mercurie Slypher|Mercurie]] tries to misty steps through a crack in the floor to the top floor but is unable to, as if magically prevented, and opts to teleport onto the elevator to get inside.
- [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] produces a journal written by her mentor, [[Rudolph van Richten]], detailing how he was cursed by [[Vistani]] to "always live amongst monsters". There is also an embalmed head of a [[Vistani]], which [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] takes so we can talk to it later. [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] suspects [[Rudolph van Richten|Rudolph]] was using this tower as a temporary camp, and that he was likely using the head as a source of information.
- [[H of H]] casts Speak with Dead on the head and asks the following questions:
	- Who are you?
		- I am [[Yan]], a [[Vistani|vistana]].
	- What is your relationship with [[Rudolph van Richten]]?
		- I don't know who that is.
	- Where is the weapon capable of killing [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]?
		- A weapon capable of killing [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]? I know of no such weapon, he is an immortal [[Vampyr]].
	- How did you die?
		- This bastard [[Rictavio]] stabbed me right through the gut! All I did was try and steal his wagon.
	- What did you hope to achieve with your life?
		- I wanted to be rich, that's all I really wanted. Now I just hope that my people are safe from that menace [[Rictavio]].
- [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] then offers to read our fortunes, though she says [[Madam Eva]] would be more skilled. She crawls underneath the wagon to avoid her own security measures and reemerges with a deck of cards. She only knows how to do a one-card reading, and says the card will tell of a powerful symbol of good, protection, and hope. She reveals the "Avenger", and says "the treasure lies in a dragon's house, in hands once clean now corrupted"
- We head back to the [[Wizard of Wines Winery]] to assess whether or not they'll be able to hold onto the magic crystal without it getting stolen by [[Druid|druids]] again. [[Elvir Martikov]] answers the door, followed shortly by [[Adrian Martikov]], who we notice has a small mark on his sleeve like the one [[Ellory Vellum|Ellory]] left on the clothes in the woods. We go upstairs to speak with them and their father [[Davian Martikov|Davian]].
- [[Mercurie Slypher|Mercurie]] asks about their ability to defend the crystal and they say they'd be able to with "normal means", though [[H of H]] suspects they aren't revealing everything, causing the party to suspects they're [[Wolfman|wolfmen]]. [[Mercurie Slypher|Mercurie]] produces the gemstone and hands it over. When asked about the other missing gemstones [[Davian Martikov|Davian]] says that one is still held by [[Baba Lysaga]], and that we should speak to [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] about the other one as it's a sore topic.
- We stay the night at the [[Wizard of Wines Winery|winery]], which is uneventful.
- the next morning we head for [[Vallaki]] and face no trouble on the road. [[Bluto Krogarov|Bluto]] greets us on the wall, having joined the town guard in a recent hiring spree. We head to the [[Blue Water Inn]] to look for [[Rictavio]] and [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]. [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] speaks with [[Danika Martikov|Danika]] about how [[Vallaki]] has been doing under [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]]'s rule, and she says the first thing he did was evict his parents from the [[Burgomaster of Vallaki's Mansion]]. They were then lynched by townsfolk and their heads are on pikes in the central square. She further mentions that the new captain of the town guard is [[Hans]], who presided over the trial. Additionally, some saber cat was accidentally let loose yesterday and it was traced back to [[Rictavio]], who left yesterday through the east gate.
- We speak with [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] about the missing crystal. He says it produced the [[Wizard of Wines Winery|winery]]'s finest wine, and that one night he was on guard duty with his father [[Davian Martikov|Davian]] when [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] himself approached. He offered a choice between handing over the gemstone or he would kill [[Davian Martikov|Davian]]. [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] suspects [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] had no particular use for the gemstone and that he just enjoyed the position it put them in. [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] wanted to give the gem over, but [[Davian Martikov|Davian]] gave up his life and [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] tore out his heart. [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] took the gemstone and replaced his heart with it, which worked and sustained [[Davian Martikov|Davian]]'s life. [[Davian Martikov|Davian]] has no knowledge of this event and believes that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] took the gemstone while [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] had snuck away to see [[Danika Martikov|Danika]].
- We mention the "[[Argynvostholt]]" and [[Danika Martikov|Danika]] mentions there's a mansion outside of town that is rumored a dragon died it in many years ago. We make plans to explore the mansion while [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] searches for [[Rictavio]] and meet back up along the road to the [[Village of Barovia]] in two to three days time.
- We arrive at the [[Argynvostholt|mansion]], which has a granite cube in front with a dragon facing east to the building. On the front door is the word "[[Argynvostholt|Argynvostholt]]". When [[Arden]] steps on the landing the dragon statue opens its mouth and exhales a 60ft cone of harmless cold air.
- Inside is a room that feels like a king's throne room. As we enter a shadow of a dragon flits across the walls. To the immediate left is a wood-paneled den with a black sarcophagus inlaid with a queen's effigy. As we enter a fire erupts in a dead hearth and a fiery, smoky dragon appears. It says "My knights have fallen into darkness. Save them if you can. Show them the light they have lost." and then vanishes.
- [[Mercurie Slypher|Mercurie]] has a useless conversation with a bat.
- In a room full of wine barrels is an emaciated dusk elf. [[Arden]] gives him a ration and heals him, he says he is [[Savid]] and that he was looking for [[Arabelle]]. He stays in the lower floor while we continue to explore.
- On the third floor we encounter a group of undead, which ask why we're disturbing them. We say we're seeking the sword to kill [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and they have no knowledge of it, but that we should speak with [[Vladimir]].
- [[Vladimir]] holds a greatsword and [[Arden]] senses some divine source on him. He tells us he used to serve as a knight of the dragon [[Argynvost]] and will return if slain in another body. He opposes all who seek to end [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s life because there is no greater punishment for [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] then his entrapment in [[Barovia]]. He further says [[Argynvost]] was a silver dragon who used to live in [[Barovia]], but [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] slew, butchered, and stripped him to the bone.
- We end the session there, planning to explore the rest of the mansion for a way to save [[Argynvost]]'s knights.
