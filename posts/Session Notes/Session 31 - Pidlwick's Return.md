- [[Mercurie Slypher|Mercurie]] summons her dog, which she can use like a drone, to explore more of the temple before we long rest.
- The dog does still trigger fireball strikes from the statue but is immune to fire. In a destroyed room some apparitions begin to appear:
    - Apparitions:
        - AC: <=13
        - Attacks: Slam (force) >= +3
        - Resistances: Fire, maybe Physical
- In another room the dog finds three amber sarcophagi similar to the ones we've seen, with one shattered. There are four one-eyed monsters that remain motionless but begin peering into [[Mercurie Slypher|Mercurie]]'s mind. She resists and the dog leaves.
- After some further exploring the dog returns to the apparition room and is killed. We attempt to long rest in [[Emil Toranescu|Emil]]'s room and are successful.
- [[H of H]] unsuccessfully casts dispel magic on the darkness cloud around the statue before remembering she can cast silence for free. This works and we can cross the room safely.
- [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] tanks some poltergeist damage and finds a scroll of Wall of Fire. In another room we find one of the people that fled our first combat in the temple resting off his wounds. [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] squeezes his name out of him, "[[Hyelk]]". He knows little of the temple and temporarily joins us as a member of the party.
- At the base of the main statue is a secret door going upward. We ascend and use the amulet to cast sunlight into the orb of darkness at the top. At the top is an old wizard who [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] swiftly restrains and gags. [[H of H]] detects his thoughts and we ask the following:
    - What is your allegiance to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
        - Neutral/opposed
    - Where is the sword of sunlight?
        - Vault?
    - Where is the vault?
        - Door behind statue
    - How open door?
        - Command phrase
    - What is the command phrase?
        - Dhaviton
    - Why are you here?
        - Guard Temple
    - What is your name?
        - [[Heinrich Stolt|Neferon]]...[[Heinrich Stolt|Heinrich]]
    - Who do you work for?
        - The wizards
- we ungag him and continue to talk. He's not interested in helping us kill [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. He says his full name is [[Heinrich Stolt]] and tries to turn invisible. [[Ellory Vellum|Ellory]] counterspells and then he just disappears anyway.
- [[Arden]] goes up to the vault doors and speaks the command word, which unlock. Inside is a room filled with treasure, a large statue of a hawk-headed humanoid, and a cracked passageway in the back. [[Arden]] reminds everyone to resist temptation and not touch the treasure.
- Through the crack in the back of the room is, miraculously, [[Pidlwick]], who raises a finger to his lips as if to shush us. We look confused and he points to the boxes. He sneaks past them and [[H of H]] reads his mind, who says there are [[Vampyr|vampyres]] hiding in the boxes.
- We head back to the vault and fight the statue:
    - Statue: 18 + 48 + 27 | 24 + 17 + 6 + 8
        - AC: 17
        - HP: ~186
        - Immunities: non-magical damage

    - thousands of electrum pieces
    - a wedding dress and five other dresses
    - a rotted chest of gold and jewelry
    - eight painted ceramic statues of saints
    - thousands of silver pieces
    - four rusted greatswords
    - suits of rusted armor
    - a silvered rapier with a pink glass hilt
    - a gilded chariot
    - the hilt of a sun blade
    - thousands of copper pieces
    - piles of gemstones
    - suits of rusted plate armor
    - rusted shields
    - child-sized sarcophagus made of black wood (mundane)
    - hundreds of iron ingots
    - piles of miscellaneous holy symbols
    - 12 copper chalices with silver linings
    - a gilded skull with garnets in its eyesockets
    - a few warhammers
    - thousands of silver pieces (again)

    - obsidian scepter with gold lining (mundane)

    - many copies of a leather-bound book called "Snow Dwarf and the Seven Wights" by Nitch Rackmay
- Treasure we take:
    - wedding dress
    - the sword hilt
    - the gilded skull
- [[Arden]] picks up the sword hilt and feels a wave of curiosity and interest. He thinks to himself "Are we ready to destroy the darkness?" and feels a wave of elation. He asks if he must find a blade and instead a blade of sunlight emits from the handle. He asks if the sword has a name, and gets a blank response.
- we end the session there and level up, planning to short rest at the beginning of next session.
