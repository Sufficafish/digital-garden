- we finish the combat at the [[Wizard of Wines Winery]] by methodically turning several different combats into a single combat. All [[Druid|druids]] were captured alive. One had an evil staff that [[Arden]] broke, releasing a scream that would have killed most of the enemies if not for the fact they were already dead. Puzzle Failed.
