Session Date: 6/8/2025

- [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] gives a very eloquent, prewritten speech proclaiming himself to be the continuation of [[Vladimir]]'s legacy through his blade, naming it "Vladimir's Regards".
- we speak with [[Emil Toranescu]], who in extremely terse and not forthcoming with information but seems to be doing so from a place of care for an unknown group he's a part of. He's unwilling to divulge information to us that could help us defeat [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] because of the risk it would pose to that group, and we eventually let him go.
- [[Ellory Vellum|Ellory]] sneaks through [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]]'s stuff at night to see if he had any other written speeches prepared and finds a note addressed to him telling [[Ellory Vellum|Ellory]] to stop looking through his stuff.
- We stay the night in [[Argynvostholt]] and head out to find [[Baba Lysaga]] the next day. We eventually arrive at a large worn down settlement and locate object on the wine crystal, sensing it in a nearby hut.
- When we approach the hut we make ourselves known to [[Baba Lysaga]], who bids us enter. During an extremely obfuscated dialogue in which she refuses to say anything straightforward and, in exchange for [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]]'s hand (which we hope to dodge by [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] marrying her), she tells us:
	- the baby she has is Strahd
	- she is Strahd's mother
	- the amber doors are in the Amber Temple
	- she will tell us where the Amber Temple is if we bring her a freshly-killed Martikov
- We end negotiations, hoping to find a loophole later, and leave for [[Krezk]] in order to ask the [[The Abbot]] about the Amber Temple. Along the way [[Arrigal]] races towards us on horseback, bringing a letter from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. It reads:
	- My friends, 
	  
	  This charade is getting out of hand. Perhaps it would be best to settle things in a civilized manner over dinner. You are cordially invited to come to Castle Ravenloft this evening to dine. Your passage here will be a safe one. I await your arrival, as do our other guests. You'd best not disappoint them. 
	  
	  Your host, 
	  Strahd Von Zarovich
- We end the session and plan to speak more with [[The Abbot]] about the bride, whether we can bring her to [[Castle Ravenloft]], and whether or not going there is smart at all.
