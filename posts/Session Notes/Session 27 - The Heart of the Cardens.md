- we immediately retrigger the [[Wight|wight]] trap and combat ensues:
	- Wight #1: 10 + 7 + 5 + 7 | 11 + 10 X
	- Wight #2: 3 + 10 + 7 + 5 | 11 + 10 X
- combat ends and [[Ellory Vellum|Ellory]] triggers the trap again from a different direction:
	- Wights: 10 + 8 + 11 | 13 + 27 X
- Similar to Sergei's tomb another room with a sarcophagus in the center is to the south through an iron portcullis. [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] lifts the portcullis enough for [[Arden]] to slip through and open the bars from the inside. The air reeks of evil and the room as a whole is much less well-maintained. As [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] and [[Arden]] approach the sarcophagus three women in soiled clothes rise from the ground below. [[H of H]] uses the amulet to cast Hold Vampire and combat ensues:
	- Yellow: 13 + 18 + 13 + 26 | 9 + 25 X
	- White: ? + 30 + 6 | 12 + 11 + ? X
	- Red: ? + 18 + 13 | 3 + 29 X
	- AC 15-16
- The [[Vampyr|vampyres]] take substantial damage from the amulet's sunlight effect. [[Ellory Vellum|Ellory]] loots the following from their bodies:
	- gold tiara: 750gp
	- gold bracelets * 10: 100gp each
	- head scarf: 750gp
	- platinum necklace with opal pendant: 1,500gp
	- platinum mask: 750gp
	- platinum rings * 10: 250gp each
- The sarcophagus in the middle of the room turns out to be empty. We long rest in Sergei's room and continue to explore east. Down a small flight of stairs are two bronze statues holding spears with a beam of light between them. [[Arden]] runs through and arrives unharmed, and we eventually figure out the beam teleports anyone not lawfully-aligned back to the top of the stairs, as if to keep them out of the room behind. In said room are two coffins, labeled King Barov van Zarovich and Queen Ravenovia van Roeyen.
- We continue to explore and arrive at a brazier surrounded by colored orbs, and the following poem:
	- Cast a stone into the fire: 
	  Violet leads to the mountain spire 
	  Orange to the castle's peak 
	  Red if lore is what you seek 
	  Green to where the coffins hide 
	  Indigo to the master's bride 
	  Blue to ancient magic's womb 
	  Yellow to the master's tomb
- [[Ellory Vellum|Ellory]] takes a look up some stairs and summons a visage of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], who says we've overstayed our welcome and glows red. He then chuckles and melts like wax into a puddle.
- [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] goes back to the cells to check for the hostages and fights two [[Vampyr Spawn|vampyr spawn]]:
	- Spawn #1: 27 + 25 | - ? + 24 | 28 X
	- Spawn #2: 26 - ? + 26 + 24 | - ? - ? + 34 | - ? + 23 + 25 X
- [[Dain Lightbringer|Dain]] swaps for [[Arden]] and [[Arden]] recovers [[Bluto Krogarov|Bluto]] and [[Ismark Kolyanavich|Ismark]], with the others somewhere else in the castle. They get dropped off in the brazier room while [[Arden]] and [[H of H]] follow a locate object spell on [[Viscero]]'s shirt to the top of the northernmost tower. Up the tower is a giant glowing crystal heart that pulsates with energy and almost throws them from the tower. Halfway up a set of halberds come to life and attack them and are dispatched with spirit guardians.
- [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] shows up and helps attack the crystal heart, which eventually shatters in a rain of blood, [[Vampyr Spawn|vampyr spawn]] climbing up the walls below. On the top of the spire are [[Viscero]] and [[Brom Martikov|Brom]] flanked by two more [[Vampyr Spawn|vampyr spawn]]. [[H of H]] casts hold vampire and [[Arden]] chucks them off the tower to their doom. They then head back down the tower and use the same strategy to fight the remaining [[Vampyr Spawn|vampyr spawn]].
- On the way back to the brazier [[Arden]] runs in to try and save [[Gertruda]] but finds [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] waiting for him. He tells everyone else to keep running, buffs up, and goes to hold [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] off for as long as he can. After a few rounds [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] gives up, turns on noclip, and phases through the floor towards the brazier. Meanwhile [[H of H]] and crew arrive at the brazier and [[Mercurie Slypher|Mercurie]] throws the violet stone into the brazier and jumps in holding [[Pidlwick]] and the rest of the stones. However after [[Mercurie Slypher|Mercurie]] jumps into the violet flame the other stones interact with the flame and [[Pidlwick]] disappears into the unknown. The brazier fire ends up being indigo and we all jump through. Shortly thereafter [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and [[Arden]] arrive in the room and [[Arden]] hurls [[Gertruda]] into the flames. [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] turns to [[Arden]] and says he will raze this valley for all we have done today, and [[Arden]] responds "as a paladin it feels wrong to leave someone so heartbroken", touches the brazier fire, and disappears.
- Everyone, sans [[Pidlwick]] and [[Mercurie Slypher|Mercurie]], appears in front of a startled [[Clovin Belview]] in the [[Abbey of St. Markovia]]. We end the session there and level up.
